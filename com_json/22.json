    "pain_points_and_needs": ["\t\u2022\t The integration between home care service providers and government agencies is incomplete", "\t\u2022\t The current dispatching and management system of home care service providers is too outdated and not efficient enough"],
    "smart_solution": "This solution provides home care services for the elderly who lives alone or is without company during the day. It also offers devices for the elderly to conduct physiological measurements at home. If the elderly falls by accident, the system can detect and report to the home care service providers in time. The project could also help to recruit caregivers suitable for a family in a timely manner. By adopting IoT smart devices, the solution could manage home care data from all the cities/counties to make home care services more comprehensive.",
