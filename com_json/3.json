    "Scenario": "It is freezing cold, and nobody could withstand the weather. The sky is gloomy and this cold front is expected to last a couple more days. Local fish farmers in Taiwan reluctantly find their milkfish dying one after another due to this drastic weather, causing a great loss to their livelihood.",
    "pain_points_and_needs": ["\t\u2022\tLack of aquaculture alarming system to cope with natural disasters ", "\t\u2022\tCurrent measures not effective to find reasons behind changes in the fish farms", "\t\u2022\tAs of now, fish farmers manage their assets by pure sight. It is difficult to get the whole picture of their aquaculture environment", "\t\u2022\tDifficult to identify factors that decrease fish farming productivity"],
    "smart_solution": " \u201cAquadlink\u201d is an intelligent aquaculture IoT service system with LoRa transmission and intelligent equipment control. Through computers, smartphones, and pads, farmers can remotely control the cultivation environment and monitor variables such as oxygen level, pH value, as well as salinity and water temperature. The IoT system not only collects water data, but also sends out early warnings through data analysis to help increase quality and yield rate.",
    "adopted_technology": "IoT sensors and controllers, data analytics via cloud and LoRa",
    "benefits": ["\t\u2022\tHelp at least 250 domestic aquaculture fields in Taiwan to monitor the critical value of the environment in real time.", "\t\u2022\tReduce loss caused by environmental factors with proper precautions and warnings", "\t\u2022\tImprove the efficiency of human operations", "\t\u2022\tCooperate with companies in the supply chain to export cultivating solution to Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines."],
