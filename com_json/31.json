    "Scenario": "Mr. Chen, 55 years old, has diabetes. The doctor advises him that people with diabetes are more likely to have retinopathy, resulting in cataracts or glaucoma. He is required to take a fundus examination regularly to keep track of his vision. However, there is no eye clinic near his house. He has to drive to a big hospital to receive medical treatment, causing him big troubles for his work and his time.",

    "smart_solution": "This solution adopts portable eye examination equipment at local hospitals, stations for optometry, health centers in communities to provide fundus examination. After taking the fundus examination, people with diabetes could use AI-powered initial screening at nearby clinics or optometrist stores to check for abnormalities as early as possible.

With this service, the patient does not need to travel back and forth from the hospital, and the rate for patients receiving follow-up medical treatment is raised by at least 65%.",
