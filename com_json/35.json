    "Scenario": "Mr. Wang, a worker, was in a severe car accident on his way to work. Unfortunately, he had his leg amputated and could only move around on a wheelchair. He bought a motorized wheelchair and one day on the bus, he and his wheelchair fell over and collided with something because of the sudden brake. He was alright, but the wheelchair was not. The wheelchair was broken and was in need of repair immediately.",
    "pain_points_and_needs": ["\t\u2022\t There is very little way to evaluate the physiological status of the disabled on a wheelchair", "\t\u2022\t It takes time for power wheelchair to be inspected and repair"],
    "smart_solution": "This solution uses IoT sensing technology to provide new intelligent functions of motorized assistive devices (such as the heartbeat, blood pressure, and body position). The platform can gain access to the user\u2019s physiological status and the status of the assistive devices. By integrating the medical institutes and customer service through cloud technology, the platform provides users with necessary consultation and assistance, and shortens time for inspection and repair. Through hand-held smart devices, the user can obtain the information regarding battery status, motor operation status, the position of the assistive devices, the toppling status of assistive devices and the pressure of the seat matt. If the assistive device is broken or needs service, immediate service could be provided to resolve the problem.",
