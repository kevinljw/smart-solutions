    "Scenario": "A-Pang goes back to his hometown and takes over the farmland from his father. He starts from an amateur knowing nothing about planting to an advanced farmer. The year before last, everyone was talking about the excellent price of bananas. A-Pang rushed to plant bananas just like others. However, when the harvest season comes, the price of bananas drops significantly. A-Pang could not even pay the harvest wages. All that he could do is let out a long sigh and embrace a bad year for farming.",
    "pain_points_and_needs": ["\t\u2022\tThe banana price is unstable and often drops significantly", "\t\u2022\tThe quality control of banana seedlings is not easy", "\t\u2022\tBanana growth is susceptible to pests and diseases", "\t\u2022\tFarmers do not know the government\u2019s planting policy. It is easy for the farmers to rush to breed"],
    "smart_solution": "The \u201cIntelligent Banana Plantation & Traceability Platform\u201d adopts the IoT technology to assist banana farmers. The platform incorporates an intelligent plant breeding system with planting technology, intelligent seed breeding room, lighting adjustment for better automation. The platform also develops highly-resistant seedlings to pests and diseases and plant preservation methods to increase the quality of bananas and to stabilize the harvest. In turn, farmers can utilize this platform to trace the quality of banana seedlings and production process for better yield.",
