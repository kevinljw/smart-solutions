    "contact": "service@communications.org.tw",
    "pain_points_and_needs": ["Low detection accuracy of current sensing equipment", "Ineffective control of pollution hot spot", "Difficult to locate suspicious pollution source in a timely manner"],
    "smart_solution": "The \"Emergency Response Platform for AI-enabled Urban Air Pollution Platform\" utilizes streetlights as the carrier, deploying 100 remotely-controlled sensing devices in the Guanyin Industrial Park in Taoyuan City to collect multidimensional data from the environment for further comparison and analysis. This Platform automatically detects the air quality every 5 seconds, sends data to the local Environmental Protection Agency to establish a 5-year historical data model, and create a 12-hour air quality prediction model. @Through AI, the goal is to establish an automated classification and prediction model based on environmental factors of the specific region, and to construct anomaly detection and back-tracing mechanism.",
